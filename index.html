            <p>
                The internet, if a country, would be the world's 7th largest emitter of CO2 pollution. It is on track to be the 2nd by 2040 on its current trajectory*. It is time to change. SEOs can play a key part in helping to clean up
                the web. Sustainable web designers are showing us the way with the <a href="https://www.sustainablewebmanifesto.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> sustainable web manifesto</a>. It's time for us to act, it's time for us to

                    <a href="https://helpx.adobe.com/photoshop-elements/using/optimizing-images.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">built into Photoshop and Illustrator</a>. It's the old 'save for web' (Alt + Ctrl + Shift + S). You can see

                    Once you have your PNG or JPEG,<a href="https://tiny-img.com/webp/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> convert it to WebP</a>for even more savings. Or

                <li>
                    Use modern protocols such as HTTP3 - this <a href="https://geekflare.com/tools/http2-test" target="_blank" rel="noopener">tool checks for HTTP2</a> and

            <ul>
                <li>User polls (internal or external) are very powerful to get stakeholders on board for changes.</li>
                <li>Start small, then push out.</li>
                <li>Try an incremental, marginal gains approach if resistance will be high - archive pages in dark mode is a great way into this.</li>
                <li>A dark mode on/off switch helps with â€˜how will it lookâ€™ jitters.</li>
                <li>Use data to contextualize your argument e.g. page CO2 weight of your pages vs the competition provides a compelling argument for change and is VERY powerful.</li>
                <li>Internal people are very up for this - find friends and get the CSR & Sustainability teams on board.</li>
