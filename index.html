      <h1>Green SEO</h1>
      <p>The internet, if a country, would be the world's 7th largest emitter of CO2 pollution. It is on track to be the 2nd by 2040 on its current trajectory*. It is time to change. SEOs can play a key part in helping to clean up the web. Sustainable web designers are showing us the way with the <a href="https://www.sustainablewebmanifesto.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">sustainable web manifesto</a>. It's time for us to act, it's time for us to change, it's time for us to drive impact to clean up the web. </p>

      <p>For conversations with developers, ask if they've heard of Steve Souders. He's a legendary early web dev, he wrote the book on web optimisation. These are his 'commandments': <br>

      </p>
      <p>For academics, this is the most comprehensive paper on how bad the internet actually is for greenhouse gas emissions. Coauthored by the brother of the inventor of the internet: <br>
        <a href="https://arxiv.org/ftp/arxiv/papers/2102/2102.02622.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://arxiv.org/ftp/<br>arxiv/papers/2102/2102.02622.pdf</a>

      <h3>Green SEO Tools</h3>
      <p>Benchmarks: These two cover most of the important sustainability metrics: <br>
        <a href="https://ecograder.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://ecograder.com/</a>
        <br>
        <a href="https://www.websitecarbon.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://www.websitecarbon.com/</a>

      <p>Here's a good overall website performance test, more legible than google lighthouse: <br>
        <a href="https://treo.sh/sitespeed" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://treo.sh/sitespeed</a>
      </p>
      <p>Fonts: Industry standard font compressor. Even if you don't change the settings at all you'll cut down ~75% of the weight, no reason not to use it: <br>
        <a href="https://www.fontsquirrel.com/tools/webfont-generator" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://www.fontsquirrel.com/<br>
          tools/webfont-generator</a>
      </p>
      <p>Images: Before you resort to online image compressors, the best image compression tool on the market is built into Photoshop and Illustrator. It's the old 'save for web' (Alt + Ctrl + Shift + S). You can see the compressed image in real time so you can compress it to a level of quality you're comfortable with: <br>
        <a href="https://helpx.adobe.com/photoshop-elements/using/optimizing-images.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://helpx.adobe.com/photoshop-elements/using/optimizing-images.html</a>
      </p>
      <p>Once you have a PNG or a Jpeg, convert it to WebP for even more savings: <br>
        <a href="https://tiny-img.com/webp/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://tiny-img.com/webp/</a>
      </p>
      <p>For SVG images, use this one: <br>
        <a href="https://jakearchibald.github.io/svgomg/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://jakearchibald.<br>github.io/svgomg/</a>
      </p>
      <p>For a unique look, look at dithering. Some clients won't love the way this looks, it’s super cool and a very powerful technique: <br>
        <a href="https://doodad.dev/dither-me-this/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://doodad.dev/dither-me-this/</a>
      </p>
      <p>Compression: Brotli compression is the best version of compression out there at the moment. Here's a tool for testing for it: <br>
        <a href="https://www.brotli.pro/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://www.brotli.pro/</a>
      </p>
      <p>HTTP2/3 - most sites still don't use it, and it saves tonnes of energy!: <br>
        <a href="https://greenspector.com/en/http2-latency-and-energy/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://greenspector.com/en/http2-latency-and-energy/</a>
      <p>Here's a tool for checking if a site has HTTP3: <br>
        <a href="https://geekflare.com/tools/http3-test" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://geekflare.com/tools/http3-test</a>
      </p>
      </p>
      <p>And here's one for checking HTTP2: <br>

      <h2 id="learnings">Learnings</h2>
      <p>Sharing our learnings on the way from our successes - so you don't have to reinvent the wheel..</p>
      <p><a href="mailto:contact@greenseo.org?subject=I would like to share these learnings from helping to green up the internet">Feel free to share with us your learnings here.</a></p>
      <ul>
        <li>User polls (intenral or external) are very powerful to get stakeholders on board for changes.</li>
        <li>Start small, then push out.</li>
        <li>Try an incremntal, marginal gains approach if resistance will be high - archive pages in dark mode is agreat way into this.</li>
        <li>A dark mode on/off switch helps with ‘how will it look’ jitters.</li>
        <li>Use data to contextulaise your argument e.g. page CO2 weight of your pages vs the competition provides a compelling argument for change and is VERY powerful.</li>
        <li>Internal people are very up for this - find friends, get the CSR & Sustainability teams on board.</li>
        <li>We talk to people about the impact of the web on the environment and invite like-minded souls to join the Green SEO movement.</li>
      </ul>
      <h2 id="problems">Problems to solve</h2>
