      <h1>GreenSEO</h1>
      <p>The internet, if a country, would be the world's 7th largest emitter of CO2 pollution. It is on track to be the 2nd by 2040 on its current trajectory*. It is time to change. SEOs can play a key part in helping to clean up the web. Sustainable web designers are showing us the way with the <a href="https://www.sustainablewebmanifesto.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">sustainable web manifesto</a>. It's time for us to act, it's time for us to change, it's time for us to drive impact to clean up the web. </p>
      <p>This website’s purpose will be to empower, connect and give you SEOs the tools you need to create a meaningful and long-lasting impact on creating a carbon-friendly internet.</p>
      <p>This website has been created to be as carbon-friendly as possible in its design, and construction. There are so many things that you can do to take action to make the internet a greener place. We hope some of these ideas and toolsets will help you make them believe that change is possible, whether it's wholesale changes or through incremental marginal gains.</p>
      <p>Together we make a difference. Together we can succeed.</p>

      <h3>Green SEO Tools</h3>
      <ul>
	  <li>Benchmark: <a href="https://ecograder.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Ecograder</a> and <a href="https://www.websitecarbon.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Website Carbon Calculator</a> cover most of the important sustainability metrics.
      </li><br>
      <li> <a href="https://digitalbeacon.co/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Digital Beacon</a> is a great tool for benchmarking and building recommendations:
      </li><br>
      <li><a href="https://treo.sh/sitespeed" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Treo Site Speed</a> is a good overall website performance test and more legible than Google Lighthouse.
      </li><br>
      <li><a href="https://www.fontsquirrel.com/tools/webfont-generator" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Fonts Squirrel's Webfont Generator</a> is an industry standard font compressor. Even if you don't change the settings at all you'll cut down ~75% of the weight, no reason not to use it.
      </li><br>
      <li>Images: Before you resort to online image compressors, the best image compression tool on the market is <a href="https://helpx.adobe.com/photoshop-elements/using/optimizing-images.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">built into Photoshop and Illustrator</a>. It's the old 'save for web' (Alt + Ctrl + Shift + S). You can see the compressed image in real-time so you can compress it to a level of quality you're comfortable with.
      </li><br>
      <li>Once you have your PNG or JPEG, <a href="https://tiny-img.com/webp/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">convert it to WebP</a> for even more savings. Or <a href="https://jakearchibald.github.io/svgomg/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">this one for converting SVGs.</li><br>
      <li>For a unique look, <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://doodad.dev/dither-me-this/">look at dithering</a>. Some clients won't love the way this looks, it’s super cool and a very powerful technique.</li><br>
	  <li>Use modern protocols such as HTTP3 - this <a href="https://geekflare.com/tools/http2-test" target="_blank" rel="noopener">tool checks for HTTP2</a> and <a href="https://domsignal.com/http3-test" target="_blank" rel="noopener">this one checks for HTTP3</a></li><br>	  
	      	  <li>Use modern compression such as Brotli - this <a href="https://www.brotli.pro/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">tool checks to see if a site supports Brotli</a></li>

      <h2 id="learnings">Learnings</h2>
      <p>Sharing our learnings on the way from our successes - so you don't have to reinvent the wheel.</p>
      <p><a href="mailto:contact@greenseo.org?subject=I would like to share these learnings from helping to green up the internet">Feel free to share with us your learnings here.</a></p>
      <ul>
        <li>User polls (internal or external) are very powerful to get stakeholders on board for changes.</li>
        <li>Start small, then push out.</li>
        <li>Try an incremental, marginal gains approach if resistance will be high - archive pages in dark mode is a great way into this.</li>
        <li>A dark mode on/off switch helps with ‘how will it look’ jitters.</li>
        <li>Use data to contextualise your argument e.g. page CO2 weight of your pages vs the competition provides a compelling argument for change and is VERY powerful.</li>
        <li>Internal people are very up for this - find friends and get the CSR & Sustainability teams on board.</li>
        <li>We talk to people about the impact of the web on the environment and invite like-minded souls to join the green SEO movement.</li>
      </ul>
