                <li>
                    Before you resort to online image compressors, the best image compression tool on the market is 
                    <a href="https://helpx.adobe.com/photoshop-elements/using/optimizing-images.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">built into Photoshop and Illustrator</a>. It's the old 'save for web' (Alt + Ctrl + Shift + S). You can see
                    the compressed image in real-time so you can compress it to a level of quality you're comfortable with.

                <li>
                    Once you have your PNG or JPEG,<a href="https://tiny-img.com/webp/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> convert it to WebP</a>for even more savings. Or

                <li>
                    Use modern protocols such as HTTP3 - this <a href="https://geekflare.com/tools/http2-test" target="_blank" rel="noopener">tool checks for HTTP2</a> and

            <ul>
                <li>User polls (internal or external) are very powerful to get stakeholders on board for changes.</li>
                <li>Start small, then push out.</li>
                <li>Try an incremental, marginal gains approach if resistance will be high - archive pages in dark mode is a great way into this.</li>
                <li>A dark mode on/off switch helps with ‘how will it look’ jitters.</li>
                <li>Use data to contextualize your argument e.g. page CO2 weight of your pages vs the competition provides a compelling argument for change and is VERY powerful.</li>
                <li>Internal people are very up for this - find friends and get the CSR & Sustainability teams on board.</li>
                <li>Talk to people about the impact of the web on the environment and invite like-minded souls to join the green SEO movement.</li>
